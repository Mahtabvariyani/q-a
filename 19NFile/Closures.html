    <h2>
      in clousers and useState both are maintaining the state but the main
      diffrence is that closures are not having only small task like useState in
      react they have a bigger and more general topics in JAvaSCript but when we
      compare they have a small similarity

  <body>
    <button id="counterButton">Click me!</button>
    <p id="counterDisplay">Counter: 0</p>

    <script>
      // Function that creates a closure to remember the count
      function createCounter() {
        let count = 0; // This variable is captured by the closure

        return function () {
          count++; // Increment the count
          document.getElementById("counterDisplay").innerText =
            "Counter: " + count;
        };
      }

      // Create a closure for the button click
      const incrementCounter = createCounter();

      // Attach the closure to the button click event
      document
        .getElementById("counterButton")
        .addEventListener("click", incrementCounter);

      //_________
      //what is closures?

      //closure is simply when two functions are nested together ...
      function init() {
        var name = "Mozilla";
        function displayName() {
          console.log(name);
        }
        displayName();
      }
      init();
    </script>
