//what is Prototype in JavaScript??


//(fist is Prototype and __proto__)

when we make an Object or an Array or any other thing in JavaScript how does it kno wthat it can have .toString()
or it can have the .sort and all of those?
well all of these coming from JavaScript Inheritance in javaScript...


so with the help of inheritance we can use the methods and all without writing the actual manuel thing for them to word out 

every Object in JavaScript has an internal Property called [[Prototype]],if we have an array and console log it we will see that there is a PRototype[[at the end ]] that i sexatly it but we can not access it directly and the only way is doing this [console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(arr))]


just liek a story:
Sure, let's imagine JavaScript as a town where objects live, and each object has its own set of special things it can do. Now, let's dive into the story:

**Once upon a time in JavaScript Town:**

In our town, every object has a unique set of things it knows how to do. We call this special set of things a "blueprint." Imagine it's like each object has its own magical instruction book.

Now, when someone in the town wants to use a special power (let's say a method or property) from an object, they first check if the object knows that power directly. If not, they don't give up; instead, they check the magical instruction book (the prototype) that comes with the object.

This instruction book might have extra powers that the object can use. If the power is found there, great! If not, they keep checking other instruction books linked together until they either find the power or reach the end of the books.

And you know what's cool? This sharing of powers among objects is what we call "inheritance." It's like passing down knowledge and abilities through generations.

Now, in our town, there's a saying, "Everything in JS is like an object." Even functions and simple things like numbers and words have a bit of magic in them. They can act like objects, too!

For instance, a function can have its own magical instruction book (a prototype), and when you create new things from that function, they inherit its powers.

So, in the end, JavaScript Town is a place where every object has its own unique skills, can share those skills with others, and even simple things have a sprinkle of magic in them, making the town a dynamic and fascinating place for developers like us!

And that, my friend, is the enchanting story of JavaScript Town and its objects. The end! ðŸŒŸ



In essence, inheritance is the concept of passing down abilities, and prototypes are the practical mechanism in JavaScript that enables this sharing of abilities among objects. The chain of prototypes creates a path for objects to find and inherit powers from one another. :smile:
