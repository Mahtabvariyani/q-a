what is the diffrence beetwen {

(null)=its still a value

{undefined} = u declred it but there si no value in it ... no value has been given

{undeclared} = never declared but used somwhere in the coden
}



how do we go about checking for any of these states?


checking the undefined you can use (typeOf)


console.log(typeOf bar)


check for undefined like 
console.log(foo === undefined)


checking for null 
console.log(foo === null)
