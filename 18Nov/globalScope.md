why is it , in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch i t?




Leaving the global scope (the space where variables live) unchanged on a website is like keeping your belongings in separate rooms. It helps prevent things from getting mixed up and makes it easier to organize and find stuff. Modifying the global space too much is like throwing everything into one big room â€“ it can lead to confusion, conflicts, and make it harder to manage and secure your things. So, it's generally a good idea to be mindful of what you put in the global space to keep your website tidy and working smoothly.
